## Vacuum 모니터링 및 성능튜닝

### 테이블 별 Vacuum상태
```
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    relname AS table_name,
    last_vacuum,
    last_autovacuum,
    last_analyze,
    last_autoanalyze,
    n_dead_tup AS dead_tuples
FROM pg_stat_all_tables
WHERE schemaname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
```

### Vacuum 진행상태 확인
```
SELECT 
    pid, 
    relname AS table_name, 
    phase, 
    heap_blks_scanned, 
    heap_blks_total, 
    index_vacuum_count 
FROM pg_stat_progress_vacuum;
```

### Vacuum 프로세스 모니터링
```
SELECT 
    pid, 
    age(now(), backend_start) AS runtime, 
    state, 
    query 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE query LIKE 'autovacuum:%'
ORDER BY runtime DESC;
```

### Vacuum 필요한 테이블 확인
```
SELECT 
    relname AS table_name, 
    n_dead_tup AS dead_tuples, 
    n_live_tup AS live_tuples, 
    vacuum_count, 
    autovacuum_count 
FROM pg_stat_all_tables 
WHERE relname = 'your_table_name';
```

### 전체 데이터베이스 XID상태 확인
```
SELECT 
    datname, 
    age(datfrozenxid) AS xid_age, 
    age(datminmxid) AS multixact_age, 
    datfrozenxid, 
    datminmxid 
FROM pg_stat_database 
WHERE datname = current_database();
```
