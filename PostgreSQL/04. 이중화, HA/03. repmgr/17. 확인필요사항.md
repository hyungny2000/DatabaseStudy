- 일단 `grant execute on pg_read_binary_file to repmgr;` 권한 추가해야 할 듯

```

postgresql.auto.conf 파일에 아래 내용 확인

primary_conninfo = 'user=repmgr connect_timeout=2 host=172.20.0.113 application_name=postrm01'
primary_slot_name = 'repmgr_slot_1'
```
- `application_name=postrm01` 이것과 관련 있을듯. 이중화 슬롯 사용 관련한 내용.
- 일단 postrm01의 데이터디렉토리 날리고, 새로이 standby clone했음.
